5|0.722222222|There are varying views among people about the duties of a government. It is argued that economic growth should be a government’s utmost priority, whilst others believe that other types of improvement are equally valuable. This essay agrees that other categories of development are equally important to economic growth. Firstly, economic development means a better standard of living for the people. The government can have the spending prowess to improve its services to the people like healthcare, education and transportation. Furthermore, it attracts foreign investors to finance businesses and thus it generates employment opportunities to people. For example, government agencies will be able to build more educational institutions allowing their people to have the necessary skills to land a job. This in return will give a nation enough workforce to support upcoming businesses from international corporations. On the other hand, relying solely on economic growth as a measuring stick of a nation’s progress can be deceiving. This is because a country may increase their gross domestic capacity but at the same the inflation rate could be increasing. The gap between rich and poor are already widening. Therefore, a county’s leaders must also focus on other attributes of development like social justice, gender equality and human rights. This will allow marginalised people in the society to feel treated fairly by the government. For instance, in China, considered an economic powerhouse second to the US, they have a dissatisfaction rating of around 58 among their people. This is largely due to the widening of social classes and human rights violations present in their country. Overall, government leaders should listen to their people and adjust to their needs. Cooperation of both authorities and its people may address conflicting views on what should be the important objective of a government. I believe that economic prosperity as well as other areas of development should be balanced uniformly in terms of government priority.|Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people, however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.|
1|0.555555556|It is preferred to live in a house by some people but living in an apartment is considered more advantageous by the other group of people. I strongly agree with the second group of residents who prefer to live in an apartment rather being in a house. Living in an apartment makes the family closely-bonded as there are not multiple floors. The family members spend more time with each other while living on the same floor as compared to living in different floors in a house. Secondly, the safety in an apartment is more as the apartment’s society is always deployed with ample number of security guards along with CCTV cameras at all floors, entrance and staircase the society events and competitions give a platform to their children to interact with kids from different religions and background. It also encourage them to perform in front of large audience which enhances their public speaking skills. In total, living in an apartment is comparatively has more plus points than residing in a house.|Some people prefer living in an apartment while others believe living in a house brings more advantages. Which, out of the two, is better?|
2|0.722222222|Women have been playing a vital role in civilization and development of the country . Women are working in every field and they have proved that they can do different tasks as well as men. Therefore, some people think that women should be allowed to work in different fields in the armed forces such as navy and air force. To commence with, women have the ability to work in every field of life.Those days are gone when women were considered to be weak member of society. Now women are working in all kinds of sectors such as blue and white collar jobs,sports,aviation and even in police departments. By working in police departments they have proven that they can take riskier types of jobs and can perform their task brilliantly. Hence, allowing females to work in defence sector can improve the sense of equality and unity among both genders and can improve the working environment. Therefore, many people emphasis that they should be allowed to work in the army. In addition, giving opportunities to female can uplift their self-esteem and respect in the society. On the other hand, many people have conflicting views. Women are generally less stronger than men and are more sensitive therefore, working in the army department will not be a piece of cake for them. Furthermore, women have to give births to children and to nurture them. For that they need maternity leaves which cannot be possible during the days of war. Also, jobs in the army requires making brave decisions such as taking someone’s life which is not possible for women because they have emotional nature. Women can join the supportive and transportation department of the country if they want to serve for the country and protect their nation . These jobs are as essential as fighting in the battleground. To recapitulate, I believe that women and men are equal but they should perform tasks that suits their nature. At the same time, women should be given chance to prove themselves and show their worth.|Some think that government should allow women to join the army, the navy and air force just like men. Do you agree or disagree?|
3|0.666666667|You should prevent health problems and illness from occurring rather than having treatments and taking medicines. Government has to distribute moneys based on this. I can’t agree with this opinion completely because I think that this it has both positive and negative aspects. First of all, I will discuss an advantage of the opinion. In general, therapy and medicine are more expensive than prevention of diseases. For example, if you get a cold and have a high fever, you have to go to see a doctor and you will pay a lot of money for the diagnosis and medicine. If you would like to keep yourself from getting a cold, you have to just wash your hands and mouth before you enter the house or eat food. Also, its cost is not expensive. So, you don’t have to pay a lot and have to do just easy things for prevention of health problems and illness. In contrast, I will write about disadvantages. Paying money for preventing health problems means paying money for healthy people. So, you pay money though you are effectively healthy. This expense may not be need. and , some diseases are difficult to prevent, for example, some types of cancer. I consider that treatment and medicine is significant as well as prevention for those illnesses and you also have to use money for the therapy and medicine. In conclusion, this opinion is double edged sword, so I can’t agree fully. It is important to use money depending on cases. For instance, in case of diseases which are relatively prevented with ease, you should pay for the prevention more.|The prevention of health problems and illness is more important than treatment and medicine. Government funding should reflect this. To what extent do you agree|
4|0.722222222|Revolution in Nuclear Technology has brought several benefits. Possession of Nuclear Weapons have created fear between countries leaving conflicts unresolved, moreover nuclear power is turned out to serve energy need economically and in environmental friendly way. However, drawbacks f nuclear technology can not be overseen which are hazardous disasters if it is misused. In my opinion, even though nuclear technology has brought plenty of advantages but cons of its usage holds more weightage. On the one hand, invention of nuclear technology has blessed mankind by providing affordable energy. Consequently, it helps to meet their power demand and foster the development of economy. Additionally, development of nuclear weapons has created threat between first world countries from each other and forcing them to resolve their conflicts by debate. As a result, there is little of no worry about arising situations like world war. Hence, it is palpable that nuclear energy has capability to flourish economy and make a world a better place to live. On the another hand, It is not wise to gloss over the perilous effects of nuclear disasters. Nowadays, terrorism is increasing at alarming rate and use of nuclear weapons by such anti humanitarian activity could be fatal. Moreover, such disasters could even occur in the process of generating nuclear power and testing nuclear weapons and effect society severally leading to deformities in many generations. For example, historical attack on Japan in World war II by nuclear missile had its effects for several decades. Therefore, nuclear technology has several negative repercussions on society. Finally, although development of nuclear technology has brought several benefits for mankind but it can not be accepted unless it becomes completely safe for mankind. It cannot be accepted as beneficial technology until there are some activists around the world who gravitate towards its use to create terror in the world. In conclusion, I believe from points above that disadvantages arising from misuse of nuclear technology as well as horrendous tragedy from nuclear disaster can overshadow all possible benefits.|The threat of nuclear weapons maintains world peace. Nuclear power provides cheap and clean energy. The benefits of nuclear technology far outweigh the disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?|
6|0.722222222|Technology has been a considerable part of our lives for ages. Especially, the aid it gives in the classroom is undeniable. I believe that conventional teachers will be removed from the classrooms and replaced by developed technology eventually. This argument is going to be proved by analyzing the fact that the amount of information technology can offer in the classroom and also being fast, adaptable and easy to access. A very important contribution of technology to the classroom and the education system is the tremendous amount of information to offer in every aspect, specifically in the classroom environment. As an example, technological devices can connect and acquire any necessary information through internet any given time and place. Traditional teachers require to do more research to be able to answer any question directed to them. Thus, technology can easily take place of the ordinary teachers on the classroom. Being adaptable, fast to response and easy to access are milestones of technology for students’ academic success. This is very apparent when any necessary information can be reached by technology very rapidly and without any struggle. Besides, adaptable teaching methods could be used easily by technological devices to target specific kind of students to be taught in an advanced way. For these kind of methods and quick responses, human teachers need to take formidable amount of training and they will be always reliant on technology. As a result if this, traditional teachers can be replaced by technological advancements. When all the points mentioned above are considered, it is obvious that technology will take place of the conventional teachers because of the amount of information it provides and being adaptable, fast and easy to access. Should teachers want to stay in the race of the future of education system, they will have to offer something unparalleled to the education of young people.|The presence of technology in the classroom has become more and more apparent and offer students tremendous resources with which to supplement their education. Given time, technology will completely replace traditional teachers in the classroom. Do you agree or disagree?|
7|0.722222222|Being able to be happy is one of the most crucial factors of life. Some people think that having enough money is the key of being happy; however, other people argue that too much money causes problems. In my opinion, the main element of being happy is directly related to money. This arguments is going to be proven by analyzing how good finance makes your life comfortable and stress free. To begin with, having enough money in your life directly makes your living conditions excel. To illustrate, when people are able to afford their needs without difficulties, they become more content. It is clear that if people do not have to worry about payments of utilities or credit cards, they could live in comfort. Thus individuals who have adequate finance to support themselves are happier in their lives. Another factor that makes having sufficient money important, is being able to live stress free. To illustrate, people who have enough income, do not have to work to earn their lives. In this way, they could easily spend more time on their hobbies or activities that make them happy. This makes if apparent that individuals who are busy with their hobbies, live life without stress. As a result if this, having enough money can be seen as an important factor that makes you happy. To conclude, when all the points mentioned above are considered, I believe that having adequate amount of money makes people happy due to having comfortable and stress-free life. Should people want to be content in life, it is vital that they had better find enough financial income.|Some people think that enough money brings happiness but others say too much money may bring problems.|
8|0.888888889|There is no doubt that education and the learning process has changed since the introduction of computers: The search for information has become easier and amusing, and connectivity has expedited the data availability. Though experts systems have made computers more intelligent, they have not yet become a substitute of the human interaction in the learning process. In my opinion what can be expected is a change of the teachers’ role, but not their disappearance from the classroom. Nobody can argue with the fact that the acquisition of knowledge is more fun and easier with computers. The mere activity of touching and exploring this device constitutes an enjoyable task for a child. This, accompanied by the relaxing attitude and software interactivity, usually contributes to a better grasping of new knowledge. At a higher educational level the availability of digital books, simulators and other academic materials provide the student with an ever accessible source of information, that otherwise would not be at hand. But, besides the increasing complexity and behavior of intelligent software, which is usually embedded in the academic digital material, the need for human interaction in the learning process will always be present, at least in the foreseeable future. There is the necessity for a human being to be able to determine what the specifics needs of each individual are. The expertise of a teacher in how to explain and adapt complex concepts to different individuals can hardly be mimicked by a computer, no matter how sophisticated its software is. As computers are becoming a common tool for teaching, teachers should be more aware of their role as guides in the acquisition of knowledge rather than transmitters of facts. They have to be open minded to the changes that are taking places, keep updated and serve as problem solvers in the learning process, thus allowing students to discover the fact for themselves. To summarize, in my personal view, teachers play and will continue to play an important role in the classroom, especially at the primary level. No matter how complex computers become, there will be no replacement for the human interaction, but in the way haw this interaction takes place.|As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom.|
9|0.888888889|Every four years, the whole world stops to watch international sporting events such as the Olympics and the Football World Cup in which athletes show their best performance to make their country proud. These sporting occasions have proved to be helpful in easing international tension in difficult times when powerful leaders were trying to control the world’s economy and other governments were fighting over the land. The Olympic Games are one of the best examples which prove how sporting events can bring nations together, at least temporarily. From the ancient History, when Greeks and Romans would interrupt battles to participate in the games, to the more recent international disputes, when athletes from Palestine and Israel would forget their differences, compete peacefully and even embrace each other after an event. Moreover, these popular events have called the world’s attention to the terrible consequences of wars; thus some leaders have tried to reach agreements to end their disputes and live peacefully. Similarly, international sporting events show benefits in some developing countries which live in a daily internal civil war. For example, Brazil has a high rate of unemployment, lack of education, hunger, crime, poverty and corruption which leads to an immense embarrassment of being Brazilian and a low self-esteem. However, when the Football World Cup starts, the Brazilian squad, which is considered the best team in the world, provokes an amazing feeling of pride in their country. Most people seem to forget all their problems and even the criminal activity decreases. They paint roads with the national colors, wear the Brazilian team shirts and buy national flags. Moreover, the competition brings families and neighbors together and even rival gangs watch the games and celebrate peacefully. In conclusion, popular sporting events play an important role in decreasing international tensions and liberating patriotic feelings as history has shown.|Popular events like the Football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tension and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.|
10|0.888888889|Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas. Today’s world has been divided into developing and industrialised countries which the main difference between them is the amount of money that governments apply in important sectors such as education, health and commerce. Most of the poorer nations are buried in debts as a result of their unbalanced finances which are reflect in a failed health care, an unstructured education system and a weak international trade. This vicious cycle will continue indefinitely unless wealthier nations show interest in minimizing the worldwide economic differences, as well as taking more responsibility for assisting less fortunate countries. Most of the African countries live in sub-human conditions because of the extreme poverty, upheaval, hunger, disease, unemployment, lack of education and both inexperienced and corrupt administrations. The devastating consequences of the AIDS epidemic in those countries could improve if the infected population were to receive free drugs to control the disease, have access to health professionals and get information on how to prevent its spread. But this can only be achieved through international help programs in which leaders of the world’s richest countries donate medicine and also send doctors and nurses to treat and educate those in need. Moreover, most of the poor countries rely on selling agricultural products and raw materials to rich nations and buying industrialized products from them resulting in a huge financial deficit. Consequently, they borrow a significant amount of money from the World Bank to try to improve their broken economies, but sometimes the money disappears with no significant changes and they cannot even pay the interest to the bank. Regarding this issue, last year the G8, which is comprised of leaders of the eight richest nations, decided to forgive billions of dollars worth of debt owed by the world’s poorest nations. In addition, they developed adequate loan programs to financially assist those countries. In conclusion, leaders of the industrialised countries play an indispensable role in assisting developing nations in dealing with essential areas such as health, education and trade. Also, their aid is the key to breaking the vicious cycle, which results in poverty and death.|Some say that rich countries should help poor countries with food and education. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.|
11|0.888888889|There have been immense advances in technology in most aspects of people’s lives, especially in the field of education. Nowadays, an increasing number of students rely on computers for research and to produce a perfect paper for school purposes. Others have decided to leave the original way of learning and to get knowledge through online schools. These changes in the learning process have brought a special concern regarding the possible decrease of importance of teachers in the classroom. Some people believe the role of teachers started to fade because computers have been helping some students to progress in their studies quicker compared to studies in an original classroom. For example, in the same classroom, students have different intellectual capacities, thus some would be tied to a slow advance in their studies because of others’ incapability of understanding. In this way, pupils could progress in their acquisition of knowledge at their own pace using computers instead of learning from teachers. However, the presence of a teacher is essential for students because the human contact influences them in positive ways. Firstly, students realize that they are not dealing with a machine but with a human being who deserves attention and respect. They also learn the importance of studying in a group and respect for other students, which helps them improve their social skills. Moreover, teachers are required in the learning process because they acknowledge some students’ deficiencies and help them to solve their problems by repeating the same explanation, giving extra exercises or even suggesting a private tutor. Hence, students can have a better chance of avoiding a failure in a subject. In conclusion, the role for teachers in the learning process is still very important and it will continue to be such in the future because no machine can replace the human interaction and its consequences.|As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom.|
12|1|I am in consummate accord with the statement that, the Earth’s natural green reserves purify its atmosphere and functions synonymously as that of the mammalian lungs. I also advocate the view that, forest destruction will ruin our present world. Firstly, from our basic knowledge of plant physiology, it can be restated that, plants by the process of photosynthesis convert the harmful carbon-dioxide gas into Oxygen, without which life cannot exist. Thus in a wider perspective, it can be stated that, the earth’s forests purify the atmosphere and thereby help in sustaining life. Secondly, environmentalists have proven that, the rapid destruction of forests is also a leading cause of global warming. Hence, destruction of the natural green reserves may lead to such a surge in the global temperature that agricultural land may become arid, leading to wide spread famine and deaths. Thirdly, forests also house diverse forms of life and these would become extinct if we continue to destroy their natural habitats. Furthermore, scientific research have proven that forest ecosystem act as natural scavengers and by the process of biodegradation, forest ecology helps in producing crude oil, which fuels our modern world and its unavailability is unimaginable as this will directly catalyse a global economic crisis. Finally forests are also source of numerous medicinal plants, from which varieties of modern medicines are produced; Quinine, an antimalarial drug, produced from the barks of Cinchona trees is the best possible example. Hence forest destruction will also be a bane for the medical community. Thus the harmony of the present wonderful will be ruined if our natural green reserves are continuously destroyed and there is a theoretical possibility that the blue planet might become lifeless if these green lungs are totally wiped out.|Forests are the lungs of the earth. Destruction of the world’s forests amounts to death of the world we currently know. To what extent do you agree or disagree?|
13|1|A vast majority of our adult life is spent working; hence it is important that we have an appropriate job that fulfils our aspirations. While financial remuneration is an important factor that attracts individuals towards a specific work, there are other factors of equal significance that make a job ideal. Firstly, the importance of financial security cannot be undermined in the modern materialistic world. Since a vast majority of people earn their livelihood from their workplace, it will be difficult for individuals with single source of income, to make their ends meet, from underpaying jobs. Thus underpaid employees, because of their financial burdens, may not be able to offer dedication and commitment at workplace, which in turn results in under-performance. Secondly, the educated refrain from being employed in underpaying jobs, as these are less attractive. Hence the remuneration associated, is an important factor that determines the value of a particular job. On the other hand, to glorify higher earning as the sole determiner of an ideal job is incorrect. This is because various other factors like work and life balance; working place culture and adequate recognition contribute towards satisfaction and contentment in work. Thus an astronomically higher paying job with a demanding employer, with poor social life in a tedious work place environment will lead to higher job dissatisfaction, which in turn will also promote higher attrition. Henceforth, it can be stated that apart from financial remuneration, which is a major determiner of a good occupation, job satisfaction is also an equally important associated factor that determines the value of a specific job.|The most important thing about a job is how much money you earn in that job. Do you agree or disagree?|
14|1|University education, even though is definitely directed towards generating lucrative employment opportunities for the advanced students; there are additional arrays of associated benefits of tertiary education that are worth mentioning. Firstly market researches in the United States and other developed countries have shown that post graduates are able to command a considerable higher salary at workplace when compared to graduates or simple high school diploma holders. Moreover, the professional world of certain white collared highly respected professions, like those of physicians, engineers, scientists can only be pursued, after graduating from the respective university courses. Furthermore, in certain fields like management, the credibility of various universities are judged by their ability to generate glittering well-paid employment offers for their fresh graduates, during their campus placements. Hence university education is definitely perceived as a means of better employability. In this context it is worth mentioning that, apart from generating lucrative jobs for students, universities also benefit the nation by creating educated societies, containing an immense pool of forward thinking individuals, who can contribute towards social development by their respective expertise. Individuals graduating from universities also additionally benefit from the multicultural environments that promote intercultural tolerance and brotherhood. The process of tertiary education also promotes teamwork and collective development amongst individuals. Over and above, numerous long lasting friendships, business partnerships and courtships also bloom from the university campus life. Finally, to sum up, it can be confidently stated that apart from generating respectable employment, there are numerous associated positive aspects of university education, which are of great social and individual significance.|Some people believe the aim of university education is to help graduates get better jobs. Others believe there are much wider benefits of university education for both individuals and society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.|
15|1|Travel industry has experienced a major boom in the later part of the 20th century and has been a boon in disguise, which has helped some weaker nations to uplift their failing economies. While questions have been raised regarding the negative impacts that accompany the growth in the travel sector, these definitely do not outweigh the associated benefits. The economic boost that accompanies a successful travel industry is quite well recognised and Thailand is the best example. The entire Thai economy revolves around tourism and the country had been able to uplift its socio economic status through its flourishing hospitality sector. Egypt is another nation that is heavily dependent on its hospitality sector. The growth in the number of incoming tourists leads to innumerable prospects in terms of local entrepreneurship & employment generation. This is also associated with international investments and infrastructure development. The national authorities, in order to ensure safety of the international visitors provide better law and order enforcement, improved transportation and healthcare facilities, which in turn benefit the local population. On the other hand, the rising influx of holidaymakers is associated with increased incidences of crimes, prostitution and antisocial activities like drugs, human trafficking and gambling, which affect the values of the indigenous society. The local population are also affected by the growth in property value indices. Environmentalists are also concerned regarding environmental remodelling, that is associated with increased tourist activities in natural reserves. In this context, it is worth mentioning that, by enforcing stern law and order and implementing strict legislations, governments can control most of these negative impacts of tourism. Henceforth, it can be confidently conveyed that, even though the growth in travel industry has accompanying negative social impacts, these do not outweigh the contributions made by this sector towards social development.|International tourism has brought enormous benefit to many places. At the same time, there is concern about its impact on local inhabitants and the environment. Do the disadvantages of international tourism outweigh the advantages?|
16|1|In modern society, with the advent of advanced telecommunication and photographic technologies, visual expression in mediums such as television, photography and films are increasingly becoming popular as powerful means of expression when compared to the simple mundane printed medium. The increasing preference and use of visual resources over written communication is an undeniable fact and the growing utilisation of video based learning in modern schools over text book based knowledge transfer is the best possible example. In the present evidence-seeking world, visual communication is a powerful tool as it provides recognisable facts. Meticulously crafted images, like political cartoons and television documentaries readily deliver the concerned messages to the onlookers and are mostly beneficial in conveying thoughts to the busy and uneducated sections of the society. The television is also being bombarded with numerous catchy advertisements, by which manufacturers try to communicate with the masses regarding their products. On the other hand, the appeal of the printed media as means of mass communication, is declining as the younger generation considers it to be relatively old fashioned and boring. Moreover, in the fast paced modern city life, less number of people can afford to dedicate time for reading the daily morning newsprints, instead, most of the city dwellers follow daily-televised news. Despite this decreased appeal for mass communication, value of the written form still stands tall in the field of interpersonal and formal communication. Written words, as a form of official documentation, can never be superseded by any other means. Thus, visual communication is definitely a popular, powerful and better tool for mass communication but written form of expression still has equal importance for official, formal and interpersonal purposes.|In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communicating than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?|
17|0.944444444|It is commonly believed that extreme sports should be strictly prohibited due to the huge number of risks involved. In this essay, I am going to demonstrate that risk factors are present in all sports before suggesting that people should have the right to play any sports they want. Advocates of banning certain sports may argue that their inherently dangerous nature may threaten lives. As extreme conditions are a prerequisite for these sports, risks like equipment failure render players more vulnerable than in other sports. For example, skydivers who freefall from enormous altitudes seem more prone to injuries or even death than players of ordinary sports. However, in reality, all physical activities carry a certain degree of risks, and it is difficult to judge which one is more hazardous than the other. For instance, acute pains like ankle sprains are prevalent in football or basketball as a result of intense practice drills and frequent matches, but it is unlikely that these sports will be banned given their popularity. Besides, people must undergo rigorous tests to ensure they are physically and mentally conditioned before participating in dangerous sports. Therefore, concerns over the safety of extreme athletes are quite irrelevant. I believe that people should have the autonomy to play any sports they want, regardless of their danger. This is because they can already decide for themselves whether to take part in a number of dangerous non-sport activities. For example, those who reach the legal drinking age are free to purchase alcohol, the excessive consumption of which may have fatal consequences. If personal freedom is championed with regard to things like alcohol, it is argued that it should be extended to sporting pursuits as well. Instead of an outright ban on extreme sports, I believe there are ways to mitigate the risks attached with them. Sports associations could impose an age limit for extreme athletes in order to ensure only people who are fully developed physically are allowed to participate. Another solution is to bar players from practicing or competing without the necessary protective gear. These measures would strike a happy medium without intruding people’s personal freedom. In conclusion, I believe people are entitled to play dangerous sports if they want, and certain restrictions in lieu of a ban would help ease the safety concerns.|Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.|
18|0.833333333|Advertising has become extremely popular and powerful over the past two decades. In fact, it has become so powerful that companies use it to manipulate us into thinking that we need their products and services. This essay will argue that companies scarcely advertise products that we need. On the other hand, we have little to no use for most of the advertised products.Major companies recognize the power of advertising; therefore, they spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on what they call an internal marketing department, which is responsible for advertising their products. Sony for instance spent 700 million US dollars on advertising last year; here one may wonder, why did they not spend that on improving their products? The answer is simple, like every huge company, Sony knows that people do not buy the better product, but the better advertised product. As mentioned above, sometimes the advertised goods are items we need, such as the first iPhone, which revolutionized the mobile industry, and Microsoft Office, which is a must have for millions of students, employees and companies worldwide. However, most of the advertised products are goods that we think that we need, but we do not. For instance, does an owner of an iPhone 5 really need to upgrade to an iPhone 5s? Millions of people annually spend a couple of hundreds of dollars on top of their iPhones to upgrade to the next iPhone once they watch a mind-blowing advertisement that features Johnny Depp or any other famous character. The advertisements usually magnify small features that the average person would barely use and lead people into believing that it is the next big thing. To conclude, Companies realize how influential advertising is. Thus, they spend astonishing figures to market their products. In addition, although we need some of the advertised products, we hardly need the majority of them.|Today, the high sales of consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?|
