First and foremost, the homecountry loses qualified people. In India, most of thedoctors and nurses recently left their home town forbetten prospects and as such, there is a shortageof experienced doctors in many states.

Thus, lack of expenienced people in theI medical field may pose a threat to the society asla whole. Though these problems cannot be solved.easily, we can definitely offer some solutions. the most important solution is to offer. lucrativebenefits in order to stop migration. In addition tothis, the government should enfonce laws that requirethese professionals to serve their country for at least5 years before they migrate. However, this measuresmay not completely resolve the issue.
